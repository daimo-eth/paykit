# Daimo Pay Contract Demo

Daimo Pay enables arbitrary contract calls from any coin on any chain,
allowing seamless payments for digital goods and user onboarding.

Example: A user is onboarding to a prediction market. Daimo Pay enables
the user to place a prediction market bet instantly during onboarding,
using any tokens they already own.

This demo uses a [`Counter` contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7f3c168DD11379748EeF71Bea70371eBA3327Ca5#code)
that can be incremented by paying 0.0001 ETH on Arbitrum. Daimo Pay
enables the user to increment the counter paying with any coin on any chain.
